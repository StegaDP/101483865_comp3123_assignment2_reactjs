# Assignment 2
## Dmitrii Stegailo - 101483865

my primary focus for this assignment was backend development and docker+docker-compose. 
I'm more of a backend guy, and it would take me a lot longer to do this assignment with both React and express.
I preferred to delete the React part to AI and focus on the backend. I think I let AI do too good of a job with frontend but all other parts are done by me. 

it's me responsible for this StateOfTheArt docker configuration which I came up all by myself. I build and extended backend by myself. 
I've tested features of the app and it works.

and I promise I'm never going to be a Frontend Developer. I have knowledge and understanding to debug, but I simply hate CSS and styling.
